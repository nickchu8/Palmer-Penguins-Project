# Palmer-Penguins-Project
# PIC16A Final Project
 The goal for this project was to use 3 machine learning models to be able to predict the species of a penguin in the Palmer Penguin dataset. There are 3 species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap.
 My group first cleaned the Palmer Penguins dataset by changing qualitative features into integers. We then performed EDA by taking a look at some different tables, scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to find which variables appeared to have a good correlation with the species of each penguin. Next, by finding the cross-validation score of different combinations of some of the features, we selected 1 qualitative feature: island, and 2 quantitative features: culmen depth and culmen length. Then for the ML models, we used Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors Classifier, and Support Vector Machines. We tested cross-validation scores to first find the optimal parameter for the K-Neighbors Classifier and Support Vector Machines. We then plotted the decision regions, found the confusion matrix, and found the test score for each model. We concluded that our best model was Logistic Regression, which achieved a score of 98.48%.
