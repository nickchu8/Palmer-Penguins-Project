# Palmer-Penguins-Project
# PIC16A Final Project
 The goal for this project was to use 3 machine learning models to be able to predict the species of a penguin in the Palmer Penguin dataset. There are 3 species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap.
 My group first cleaned the Palmer Penguins dataset by changing qualitative features into integers. We then performed EDA by taking a look at some different tables, scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to find which variables appeared to have a good correlation with the species of each penguin. Next, by finding the cross-validation score of different combinations of some of the features, we selected 1 qualitative feature: island, and 2 quantitative features: culmen depth and culmen length. Then for the ML models, we used Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors Classifier, and Support Vector Machines. We tested cross-validation scores to first find the optimal parameter for K-Neighbors Classifier and Support Vector Machines.
